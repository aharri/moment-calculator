Beam end moment balancer based on Cross' method.

Currently this does only the balancing calculations
you would do on paper. You need to calculate starting
values (MK), multipliers (Î¼) and define the structure.
The benefit is that this isn't error prone like calculations
by hand and you can also see intermediate values (for
checking calculations done on paper).
