Beam end moment balancer based on Cross' method.

Currently this does only the balancing calculations
you would do on paper. You need to calculate starting
values (MK), multipliers (Î¼) and define the structure.
The benefit is that this isn't error prone like calculations
by hand and you can also see intermediate values (for
checking calculations done on paper).

There are two versions, one for PHP which is a bit more
complete and one for MathCAD that gets the job done too.
MathCAD version doesn't have verbose outputing, just the
calculations.
